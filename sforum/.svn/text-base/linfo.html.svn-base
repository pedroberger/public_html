<p align="justify"> Brasilia was constructed between 1956 and 1960 and inaugurated, as the new Brazilian Capital, in April 21, 1960. Its master plan ("Plano Piloto") was conceived by Lucio Costa, and its major buildings were designed by Oscar Niemeyer. Known internationally for the modernity of its architecture and urban design in the shape of an airplane (or a bird, as Lucio Costa conceived it), Brasilia has been declared by the UNESCO as "Patrimony of Humanity". The city and its District are located in the Central-West region of the country, along a plateau known as Planalto Central.

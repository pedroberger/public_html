<b>Suggestions for Formatting Your Poster</b>
<ul align="left">
<li>Place heading in large‚Äêsized type at the top of the board</li>
<li>List the title and all authors</li>
<li>All material should be readable from distances of one meter or more</li>
<li>You are strongly encouraged to use a type that is at least 22 pt. minimum</li>
<li>Use bold type to ensure legibility</li>
<li>Make all print very dark (preferably block style) on a very light (preferably white) background</li>
<li>Visuals should be simple. Leave out or remove any unnecessary details.</li>
<li>Use color to enhance comprehension, not to decorate the poster (use of color can visually enhance your poster)</li>
<li>Use letters, arrows, numbers, or other devices to show those who will be viewing your poster the preferred sequence in which your poster should be reviewed</li>
<li>Charts, drawings, and illustrations should be similar to those you would use in making power point slides</li>
<li>Present numerical data in the form of graphs, rather then tables (graphs make trends in the data much more evident). If data must be presented in table-form, KEEP IT SIMPLE</li>
<li>Make sure that any visual can "stand alone" (i. e., graph axes are properly labeled, maps have north arrows and distance scales, symbols are explained, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The XII Microelectronics Students Forum (SFORUM-2012) is an event promoted by the Brazilian Microelectronics Society (SBMicro) and the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) with the following main goals:</p>
<p align="justify">
<ul  align="justify">
<li>Promote the participation of undergraduate students in the three most important Brazilian events in the area of Microelectronics: "SBMicro 2012: Symposium on Microelectronics Technology and Devices", "SBCCI 2012: Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design" and WCAS 2012: Workshop on Circuits and Systems Design;</li>
<li>Promote the realization of students' projects in a variety of topics within the field of microelectronics;</li>
<li>Provide an opportunity for the presentation and discussion of research projects developed by undergraduate students and beginner graduate students (master) in microelectronics;</li>
<li>Promote advanced tutorial presentations on microelectronics understandable for undergraduate and graduate students starting or willing to start in this promising field.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p align="justify">We encourage undergraduate students to submit an article on their research projects, including technical and/or scientific results achieved on micro fabrication process, device fabrication or characterization, simulation, prototyping, system development, layout features and related issues.</p>
<p align="justify">Submissions from beginner graduate students, starting or willing to start their master project, will also be considered.</p>
<p align="justify">The students are invited to submit papers having 2 to 4 pages, in English, in double-column format.  The best papers will be invited for oral presentations.</p>

<!--<h3 align="left"><strong>Abstract:</strong></h3>


<p align="justify">For more than four decades Moore’s Law has provided a steady exponential grow where each new technology node provided a win-win situation as shrinking features sizes not only led to more complex circuits but also led to faster and less expensive embedded on-chip systems. As Moore’s Law approaches physical limits, though, reliability becomes a severe problem: aging effects like electro migration, NBTI, increased susceptibility against soft errors etc. increasingly jeopardize reliability.
The talk starts with an overview of aging and soft error effects and deducts that many reliability-threatening effects are directly or indirectly related to thermal issues. The talk gives some background on thermal issues and also presents effective solutions that scale especially with respect to multi-core systems.

Dr. David L. Harame led the development of the world's first successful silicon germanium (SiGe) technology generally available for analog and communications circuits used in wireless communications equipment, optical network interfaces,GPS and cellular telephones. Dr. Harame was the first to make SiGe devices using ultra high-vacuum chemical vapor deposition to deposit the SiGe layer. The technologies he developed and later installed in IBM's Essex Junction, Vermont manufacturing facility in 1998, set records for the performance of silicon bipolar transistors and is still running in high volume today. Based on his work, SiGe HBTs now exceed frequencies of 390 GHz. This enables products based on existing compound semiconductor technology to be replaced with higher-performance,lower-power and lower-cost SiGe HBT technology commonly used in many products containing high-frequency analog circuits such as cell phone, WLAN, high-speed test and fiber optic applications.

An IEEE and IBM Fellow, Dr. Harame has received two IBM Outstanding Innovation Awards.

The SBMicro symposium is an international forum dedicated to fabrication and modeling of microsystems, integrated circuits and devices, held annually in Brazil. The goal of the symposium is to bring together researchers in the areas of processing, materials, characterization, modeling and TCAD of integrated circuits, microsensors, microactuators and MEMS. The SBMicro2012 will be located in Bras√≠lia, Brazil. This international conference offers a unique blend of microelectronics and serves as a major conference for the discussion of interdisciplinary research around the world through a variety of formats, such as oral presentations, poster sessions, exhibits, panel discussions, and tutorial sessions. The best papers presented at the symposium will be invited to resubmit an extended version that will be considered for publication at the JICS - Journal of Integrated Circuits and Systems and at the Journal of the Electrochemical Society. SBMicro2012 will occur in the same venue as SBCCI2012 - 25th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design.</p>

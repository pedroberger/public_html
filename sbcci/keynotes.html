<h3 align="left"><strong>Embedded On-Chip Reliability – It’s a Thermal Challenge</br>
Jörg Henkel</br>
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany</strong></h3>

<h3 align="left"><strong>Abstract:</strong></h3>


<p align="justify">For more than four decades Moore’s Law has provided a steady exponential grow where each new technology node provided a win-win situation as shrinking features sizes not only led to more complex circuits but also led to faster and less expensive embedded on-chip systems. As Moore’s Law approaches physical limits, though, reliability becomes a severe problem: aging effects like electro migration, NBTI, increased susceptibility against soft errors etc. increasingly jeopardize reliability.
The talk starts with an overview of aging and soft error effects and deducts that many reliability-threatening effects are directly or indirectly related to thermal issues. The talk gives some background on thermal issues and also presents effective solutions that scale especially with respect to multi-core systems.

<p align="justify">Jörg Henkel is currently with Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany, where he is directing the Chair for Embedded Systems CES. Before, he was with NEC Laboratories in Princeton, NJ. His current research is focused on design and architectures for embedded systems with focus on low power and reliability. Prof. Henkel has organized various embedded systems and low power ACM/IEEE conferences/ symposia as General Chair and Program Chair and was a Guest Editor on these topics in various Journals like the IEEE Computer Magazine. He was Program Chair of CODES'01, RSP'02, ISLPED/06, SIPS'08 and CASES'09, Estimedia'11, VLSI Design'12, ICCAD’12  and served as General Chair for CODES'02, ISLPED 2009 and Estimedia 2012. He is/has been a steering committee member of major conferences in the embedded systems field like at ICCAD, ISLPED, Codes+ISSS, CASES and is/has been an editorial board member of various journals like the IEEE TVLSI, IEEE TCAD, JOLPE etc. He has given full/half-day tutorials at leading conferences like DAC, ICCAD, DATE etc. and has delivered several keynotes and participated in several panels.
Prof. Henkel received the 2008 DATE Best Paper Award, the 2009 IEEE/ACM William J. Mc Calla ICCAD Best Paper Award, the Codes+ISSS 2011 Best Paper Award and the MaXentric Technologies AHS 2011 Best Paper Award. He is the Chairman of the IEEE Computer Society, Germany Section, and the Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (ACM TECS). He is an initiator and the coordinator of the German Research Foundation's (DFG) program on 'Dependable Embedded Systems' (SPP 1500). Since 2012 he is an elected Board Member of the German Research Foundation’s (DFG) board on “Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems. He holds ten US patents.

SBCCI is an international forum dedicated to integrated circuits and systems design, test and electronic design automation (EDA), held annually in Brazil. The 25th SBCCI will take place at Brasília, Brazil's capital. The goal of the symposium is to bring together researchers in the areas of EDA, design and test of integrated circuits and systems. The scope of the symposium includes technical sessions, tutorials and panels, as well as an exhibition and working group meetings. The best papers presented at the symposium will be invited to resubmit an extended version to be considered for publication at the IEEE Design & Test and at the JICS - Journal of Integrated Circuits and Systems.
</p>
<p align="justify">
SBCCI strongly encourages international submissions. Prospective authors from around the world are invited to submit original manuscripts in English for consideration by the Program Committee. Manuscripts must contain a maximum of 10 pages, using 11-point font or larger and 1.5 or double spacing and be prepared for blind review. Authors are encouraged to submit the paper in the final publication version as two-column, 6-page papers, following the ACM Press guidelines. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
The submission is double blind, so please avoid any possibility to disclose the reviewer the identity of the authors.
</p>
    
<p align="justify">
    Submissions of manuscripts previously published at other conferences or journals will not be considered for publication by the program committee. SBCCI submissions must be made electronically (in PDF format) via the conference website.

<p align="justify">The Second Workshop on Circuits and System Design - WCAS 2012 is devoted to the presentation and discussion of design experiences with a high degree of relevance in industrial and educational contexts, as well as innovative design methodologies and applications of specific design technologies in an industrial context. 
The workshop in organized within two tracks: industrial and academic. Contributions should illustrate state-of-the-art designs, design methodologies or tools, which will provide viable solutions in tomorrow's silicon and embedded systems. Designs that achieve a specific record in terms of performance, power management or any other concrete advantage compared to the state-of-the-art for a given application domain should also be submitted to this workshop. Validated methodologies and techniques through demonstration are welcome. 
The authors are invited to submit 6-page double column version of the paper. The accepted papers will be presented in poster sessions or in oral sessions. The main idea of the workshop is to offer the chance (primarily to industry) of pointing out to the community real-life design and technology challenges that should be addressed in the short-to-medium term.
